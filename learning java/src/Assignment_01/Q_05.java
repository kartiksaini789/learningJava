/* 5Q.  WAP in Java which would contain 8 objects of a Class Employee.
		Employee contains name, age, department, salary. Your program would
		be able to calculate the total salary to be paid in each department. Use
		constructors to create these 8 objects and Scanner to take inputs.
		Restrictions:
		1- Minimum 8 objects [can be created manually with parameterized
		constructors with Scanner input]
		2- Departments are, A, B, C, D: minimum 4 departments [String Type]
		3- If the Salary exceeds more than 30,000, then the default salary
		would be 25000 of any of the employee
		4- Use array of objects, instead of using multiple 8 objects separately
		Use:
		Employee arr[] = new Employee[8];
		And
		arr[i].department.equals("A");
